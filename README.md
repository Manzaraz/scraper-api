## In this project i learned how to:

    1. come with an API idea.
    2. Develop the API.
    3. Put it on the RapidAPI Marketplace.
    4. Profit!

this project is thought-out to create a Javascrpit backend application using Node and Express and deploy it for "business aspects"

## The main idea is to build:

    * An Amazon Data Scraper: to get access to product, price, sales, and reviews data from Amazon in JSON format.

## Features:

    ‚Ä¢ GET Search results.
    ‚Ä¢ GET Product offers.
    ‚Ä¢ GET Product reviews.
    ‚Ä¢ GET Product details.

## For build this project i worked with some tools like :

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/es/).

## To deploy it I used:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (the example deployed is [here](https://git.heroku.com/manzi-amazon-scraper.git)).
- [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com) (is deployed [here](https://rapidapi.com/Manzaraz/api/manzi-amazon-data-scraper1/)).
